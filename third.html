        <p>A gift—here night isn’t scary; the unknown is exhilarating and the ending sunny and clear.</p>
        <p>In spare, poignant, direct prose, I Hate Everyone paints a nuanced and honest portrait of the complex emotional lives of children.</p>
        <p>
          "I hate everyone." In your worst mood, it's a phrase you might want to shout out loud, even if, deep down, you don't really mean it. Set at a birthday party, this disgruntled, first-person story portrays the confusing feelings that sometimes make it impossible to be nice, even-or especially-when everyone else is in a partying mode. A gorgeous, poetic contemplation, sure to elicit a reaction from readers. A worthy successor to Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.

        <p>Roused from sleep, two siblings head out into the night, walking in darkness with their parents to an undisclosed destination.</p>
        <p>
          “Let’s go, so we get there on time,” their mother urges. The family walks enshrouded in blue night, through the “sleeping village,” past a big hotel lit up “like a chandelier,” into cow-dotted countryside, finally reaching thick woods. Watercolor-and–graphite pencil illustrations depict an enveloping nocturnal world through saturations of indigo. Young readers’ hearts will quicken, feeling embraced by night made real with breathtaking, full-bleed washes of blue that stretch across
          double-page spreads. This wondrous darkness gleams with reassuring lights (from lamps, windows, flashlights, glinting stars, a woozy moon) while meticulous pencil work provides specificity. A sweater’s cables claim readers’ attention, as do blades of grass, pine needles, fronds of fern, and a lacework of leaves in a magical night sky perforated by stars. Equally evocative sentences (in taut translations from French) appear in clear, white lettering, engaging the senses: “We threaded
          through the whispering forest. The earth was damp, the bark smelled comforting.” Keeping pace with this family, readers wonder where they’re headed and why they must start to hurry near the book’s conclusion. Urgency, exhilaration, and anticipation make the walk’s conclusion, a luminous, lemony daybreak, all the more powerful. All family members have pale skin and dark hair.
